# Object-Oriented Programming
Welcome to the Object-Oriented Programming course repository! This course focuses on fundamental and specialized concepts and structures related to object-oriented programming languages using JAVA and C++.

## Course Overview
ECE326 Object-Oriented Programming delves into the principles and practices of object-oriented programming using two widely-used languages, Java and C++.

## Course Content
For Java:
- Classes, constructors, method overloading, static/final methods/variables
- Packages, access modifiers
- Inheritance and polymorphism, Abstract/final classes, method overriding
- Interfaces
- Exceptions
- File I/O (binary and Stream I/O)
- Nested classes (anonymous, local, static)
- Generics & Java Collections Framework
- Networking (URL, URLConnection, sockets)
- Regular Expressions
- Swing (Buttons, events, listeners, containers, layout managers, menus, text fields, graphics class, colors, fonts, etc)

For C++:
- Arrays, pointers, references, strings
- Dynamic memory management
- Classes and Object Creation: constructors and destructors, object creation and object lifecycle, friend methods, const methods, this pointer
- Namespaces, access modifiers
- Inheritance, dynamic polymorphism, abstract classes, multiple inheritance
- Operator overloading
- Exceptions
- Streams, Files
- Templates, Standard Template Library (STL)
  
## Getting Started
To get started with the course content, navigate to the respective folders for each language. You'll find code examples, exercises, and resources to deepen your understanding of object-oriented programming concepts in Java and C++.

### Java
1. HW1 was about creating a java programm that implements an english dictionary by using a Compressed Trie with radix base. Compressed is any tree whose nodes that are not terminal, and have only one child, are united with their child.
2. In HW2 i have implemented a programm for Image Processing. Some functions are:
   1. Open and saved images as PPM or YUV
   2. Increase or Decrease size of an image
   3. Greyscale
   4. Rotate Clockwise
   5. Equalize Histogram
   6. The stacking Algorithm
3. Using Java Swing in HW3 there is my implementation for a Sudoku  game.

### C++
1. HW4 contains the code for a HashTable( for string without spaces). Main functionalities have been implemented, such as ADD, REMOVE and SEARCH, along with the Rehashing Class.
2. HW5 is about creating Graphs using a templated class. Adding and removing edges and vertices, printing DFS and BFS, finding shortest path using Dijkstra's Algorithm and finding Minimum Spanning Tree.
